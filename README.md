# awren nuit’s Full Stack Software Engineer Portfolio

## Description

Hi! I’m awren, and I bring ideas to reality. This repository contains some of my adventures in web development and software engineering. Just for my portfolio I built a CSS Sandbox where new and experienced programmers alike can play around with some common styling properties, then copy the code into their projects.

<strong>I am always interested in hearing about new opportunities, and can be reached by email at [awren.nuit@gmail.com](mailto:awren.nuit@gmail.com?subject=I%20Loved%20Your%20Portfolio).</strong>

## Setup

- download or clone this repo
- `npm i` from the command line
- `npm start` to launch the project
- enjoy!
