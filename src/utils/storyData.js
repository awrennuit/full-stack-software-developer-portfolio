    content: `The Blasphemous Lord beseeched the gods for power and triumph in battle. He promised them anything if they gave him the strength to conquer the region. For a thousand years he waged war, and for a thousand years he saw victory. The people he defeated were forced to build palaces, monuments, and dungeons in his name. But no sooner had he claimed ownership over the last city than the gods came to collect on his promise. They took his soul. A squad of rebels tracking him watched as the Blasphemous Lord’s lifeless body fell to the ground, decaying at an accelerated rate. As word of this spread, the people began tearing down all that was built under his rule. Today nothing of the Blasphemous Lord remains, save an abandoned crypt recently discovered by a band of cultists...`,

    content: `While staying at The Dancing Frog, a traveler recounts the harrowing story of a storm that almost took her life. Many years ago she was making the trek from Port Steremer to Myrkfel. Everything started off the same as any other journey in the snowy season. The weather was fine if a little cold. The paths near Port Steremer were well-maintained and easy to traverse.

The woods provided some cover as the snow came down harder. She rested a bit near the pond there. Merchants had little shops set up there year round. As she made her way out of the woods the storm really picked up. The whiteout conditions got worse until she couldn’t see where she was going. She kept telling herself ‘just one more mile.’ She got colder and colder until eventually she could no longer continue. She resigned herself to this fate and was lulled into a cold slumber.
    
Miraculously, she awoke the next morning in a warm tent. She learned that a group of people happened upon her as she was being buried in snow. They had dug her out, got her into dry clothes, and tucked her into bed. The next day was bright and sunny. Snow fell off the trees as it melted. She accompanied her rescuers to their destination - The Dancing Frog. They spent the evening dancing, telling stories, and playing tavern games. The next day they went their separate ways.
    
Each snowy season the traveler spends a few nights at The Dancing Frog telling the story. She always hopes to reconnect with the people who saved her. Maybe one day she will.`,

    content: `During the week-long Festival of Radiance celebration Emperor Marcel IX suddenly collapsed. Ceremonies were brought to a halt. Shocked gasps could be heard. The populace waited with bated breath as a health officials tended to him. After what seemed like an eternity, one of them spoke:

“The Emperor is dead.”
    
For the first time in history the Festival of Radiance was canceled. Emperor Marcel IX was adored by many. He was fair and kind. He did his best to help the most destitute and always made time to hear everyone’s praises, complaints, and requests. The people mourned his passing. There was never an Emperor like Marcel IX, and there may never will be another like him. They feared for the kingdom’s future. Everything was uncertain now.
    
After a few days of grieving, a group of people came forward with a plan to gain clarity in the times ahead. They would head east to an abandoned town called Pelmer. There have long been rumors of an oracle living around that area. Perhaps she could guide them, tell them what to do.
    
And so they set out for Pelmer. They reached the town as night descended. It was certainly abandoned. The majority of buildings were falling apart. They called out for the oracle. After a time she revealed herself and invited everyone into her home. It was like stepping into another world, or even a dream.
    
She asked them to drink some tea with her, then began channeling Time itself. Reality seemed to warp and flex. Strange sounds faded in and out. One person swears they made out the voice of a woman faintly through the static like some kind of warning. Slowly reality became more firm again. The oracle gave them a prophecy. The kingdom would prosper once again, but not until another great tragedy befalls it. The townspeople beseeched her for more information. She refused to speak further.
    
The oracle invited everyone to stay the night in Pelmer. Though the houses looked bad on the outside they were still quite nice on the inside. Seeing as it was already dark outside the group agreed. They had planned on staying the night at The Dancing Frog. It was much too late to make the journey there.
    
Quickly they fell asleep. And dreamed. Or did they? Everything seemed so real. Too real. Happiness. Sorrow. Anger. Serenity. Constantly changing experiences. From her home, the oracle grinned. She had trapped them with her enchantment. They would sustain her life force. And there they would lie in vivid slumber until they were released from the spell.`,

    content: `A group of venturesome youths found a satchel deep within Meadowtrek Woods. Inside was a weather-worn journal. Immediately intrigued, they began to look through it. Many of the pages were illegible. No author detail could be found. One section contained detailed notes on the plants & animals that inhabit the woods. Another section was filled with observations and personal entries. Enclosed are some excerpts:

Entry 1: Walking through Meadowtrek Woods is an experience unlike any other. It is vast and sprawling, covering a massive portion of northern Dausedmera. The forest is home to much biodiversity. Commonly traveled parts of the forest have been tamed by human hands over hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years. The footpath is well established to the point of it being a central road connecting the port to other parts of the realm. Sunlight filters downward through the lush canopy providing the right balance of light and shade so as to not dehydrate the traveler on their journey. Partway along the path is the merchant lake. Many small stalls are set up year-round. Some temporary, some permanent. People often camp out in the clearing. It is its own small community.
    
Entry 4: Now a fair distance from the commotion of the main path, the woods have a tighter hold on things. No doubt occasional explorers like myself wander out here. The telltale signs of civilization are nearly absent. The canopy is more full. The undergrowth is thick, save for a few scattered trails that are nearly overgrown. And the sound. So many creatures are seemingly speaking over each other. It is at once comforting and deafening. The creatures themselves, it seems, are rather elusive. It is incredible that these invisible beasts can produce such a din.
    
Entry 5: Further still the unruly nature of the woods is steadily increasing. In the distance lights dance between the trees. Bobbing up and down from the bushes. Their rhythm is almost hypnotic, enticing me to seek out the source. This is a species not yet documented in any of the tomes I have read in preparation for this outing. From here they appear to be large flying insects of some sort. Or perhaps a species of bird or bat that draws their prey in with lights. Many are the birds that eat moths and their ilk. Though it is darker here it does not seem to be dark enough to warrant bioluminescence.
    
Entry 9: My inquisitive nature has gotten the better of me it seems. Night has descended and I fear I must make camp out here in the thicket. Earlier I had the presence of mind to start a small fire in case this scenario unfolded. Curiously, the dancing lights have all but disappeared. One would think that night time would be the most opportune time for them to find their prey. Perhaps I will be able to find them in the morning. I do not know how to describe it, but it feels as if thousands of eyes are staring back at me from the darkness. Every rustle, every snapped twig only serves to heighten my growing panic. Are these the creatures I was hearing earlier? The cacophony has faded away. The forest is substantially quieter. Could it be the source of the noise is now gazing from the shadows? If this is to be my end, then grant me one last wish: that this journal and its contents be submitted to the Tower for publication. It would be a shame for my research to be forgotten.`,

    content: `In the heart of the castle’s business district nestled among the winding streets and shadowy alleyways stands the Three Horses Inn. It’s a raucous hangout for weary travelers and locals alike. Its well-maintained sign swings gently in the evening breeze, announcing its presence with a slight squeak. This evening the tavern is bustling with activity as patrons gather around the tables, excited for the upcoming performance.

A troupe of musicians is going to unveil their latest work tonight. Their instruments are on the stage, ready to be played. There is a flute, some hand drums, and stringed instruments of various sizes. By the look of things the troupe consists of about five or six members. No one knows which of the inn’s patrons are part of the band, but there are some bets going about who might be one of the performers. You place a few bets of your own, hoping to make some money. Rumor has it that the tall, thin gentleman with the big feather in his hat and the sort of mysterious lady in the corner are part of the troupe. You decide to roll with the odds and put your money on them.
    
While most of the inn’s guests are engaging in evening revelry, there might also be more sinister activities taking place. In the midst of the festivities you have been noticing a few *very* normal looking people who have been trying to act as unsuspicious as possible. However, you can't help but notice their darting eyes and the small packages discretely changing hands. Despite this shady behavior they don't appear to be a threat...at least for now.
    
Someone walks onto the stage in the middle of the room and announces the musical act. The crowd is noticeably quieter now - perhaps in anticipation of the music, perhaps to see if they won big or lost hard with their wagers. The man with the big feather in his hat walks onto the stage alongside four other people. The mysterious lady isn’t one of them. Oh well. You end up more or less breaking even with your wagers.
    
The man in the feather hat appears to be the band leader. He thanks everyone for being there. The crowd becomes even quieter. You settle back into your booth, sip your drink, and listen as the music starts...`,

    content: `Three explorers banded together to travel far off the established path. Their primary goal was to see if there was any credence to the legends. As an added bonus they could also map the land. After spending the night at The Dancing Frog they set out south toward the mountains with the intent to follow them east into the thicket. From there they planned on braving the thicket to see if they could find any trace of the fabled Castle of Leaves.

About half a day’s journey later they arrived at the base of the mountains. The explorers regarded the mountains with awe. Ever since an Emperor from centuries past decreed these mountains off-limits no one had dared venture this close to them. They had been erased from the historical record, surviving only in oral tradition as the ‘Forbidden Mountains.’ Boldly, the group made sketches and penned notes about the area before heading east.
    
It was not long before they reached the thicket. The explorers were taken aback by the amount of streams appearing to flow into it. Everything else in the realm of Dausedmera is so barren and dry. Dozens of small rivers seemed to appear out of nowhere, emerging from an unknown water source. They speculated that the source must have been underground, but if that were the case how would the water be flowing UPWARD from beneath them?
    
The group entered the thicket. The vegetation was so dense that they wondered how anything could survive here. Barely any sunlight filtered down from the low canopy. The trek through was a slog of hacking and slashing, and they were covered in little cuts from the bramble. The explorers were thankful they hadn’t encountered any dangerous creatures yet.
    
Suddenly they emerged into a clearing that contained some ancient stone ruins. It looked as though this area was once inhabited. But how could that be when there was no record of civilization in this area? The explorers all agreed that there was an unsettling feeling about this place. Almost as if whoever lived there vanished all at once...possibly thousands of years ago.
    
One of the explorers motioned to the others to be quiet. She had heard the subtle sound of twigs cracking. The sound grew louder. Closer. The tension was palpable as the explorers readied themselves to either fight or run to safety. The sound grew louder still, now accompanied by loud thuds that vibrated the ground around them. Tension had been wholly replaced by fear.
    
A massive being made of rock and dirt emerged from the brush. It approached the explorers. They wanted to scream. They wanted to run. Instead they were paralyzed by terror. One of them stammered “it’s...it’s not real.” The golem drew ever closer. Then it spoke. It asked them why they came to this place. When it received no response, it assured the explorers that it meant no harm. It knew that the explorers presented no threat to it so it saw no reason to destroy them.
    
Slowly, one of the explorers managed to string together some words. She told it that they were looking for the Castle of Leaves. It said there was no use of trying to find this Castle. It is a place that can only be found if it wants to be found. As the explorers calmed down, they began asking the golem all sorts of questions. What it is. How it came to be. Why it’s here. What its purpose is.
    
The golem recounted stories of the past. Eons before humans ever existed. It knew not where it came from or how it was created. Just that it had always been here. It spoke of giant beasts that once ruled the land. Then of an ancient group to the southeast. Then it spoke of how humans rose to power through war and manipulation.
    
It made itself clear that humans are unworthy of this land. However, it felt that it wasn’t meant to interfere with the natural order of things. Lastly it spoke of a great castle to the south, and warned that it WOULD take action to prevent the explorers from getting any closer to it. The castle was free from human corruption and was intended to remain as such. The group wrote all of these stories down and contemplated their next move - to sneak to the castle? or to heed the golem’s warnings and return home?`,

    content: `An alchemist has been secretly working with a necromancer to see what effects, if any, a newly-discovered mushroom will have on the undead. Even small doses of heavily diluted preparations have proven fatal to humans. But what if the human is already dead?

Some of the constituents point toward this particular fungus having mystical powers. This hypothesis is due to a similar, though inactive, component that has been found in ancient magickal artifacts. Perhaps this holds the secrets to mind control. Invisibility. Eternal life. Flight. Or so many other abilities.
    
The necromancer summons forth one of the dead to participate in the first trial. Test Subject #1 is a recently deceased man. The alchemist provides instructions and hands a small vial of glowing liquid to the undead man, then she hides behind a thick pane of glass. Safety first, you know.
    
Test Subject #1 sits down and drinks the vial, just as instructed. After about 30 seconds he begins to glow all the colors of the rainbow, shifting and morphing. All at once he explodes in a ball of brilliant light. The first test is a failure.
    
A second corpse is brought in by the necromancer. Another male, but this time in an active state of decay - still fleshy with some bones starting to peek through. The alchemist makes some adjustments to the formula before handing it over to Test Subject #2. This corpse changes colors just like the last one, but also sprouts something that looks like small wings from his back. Then he explodes in a glorious blaze. Another failure, but showing some promise.
    
The alchemist asks if some more skeletal remains could be reanimated and brought in. Perhaps it is the fleshy bits causing an issue. The necromancer grumbles something about not being an ‘errand boy’ as he leaves.
    
Upon his return, the alchemist is pleased that two test subjects were brought in. One is just a skeleton, which is what she asked for. The other is a very fresh cadaver.The necromancer states that he brought the most decayed and least decayed bodies he could find. They are labelled Test Subject #3 and #4, respectively.
    
The alchemist instructs both of them to drink the vial at the same time. Then she and the necromancer step behind the pane of glass. Both subjects drink the vial at the same time. Both begin to rapidly change colors. The alchemist lets out a frustrated sigh since she already knows what this will lead to. Test Subject #4, the fresh corpse, explodes.
    
Test Subject #3, however, sprouts large skeletal wings...and does NOT explode. Perhaps flesh is the issue. Enamoured with this breakthrough, the alchemist begins running tests on the skeleton. It isn’t long before she realizes that it can regenerate - if part of a bone is cut out it regrows almost immediately.
    
This leads to some _interesting_ (read: unethical) tests on live humans. Ingesting even a small amount of ground up bone has the power to miraculously heal every condition that was tested. Could this skeletal angel be the secret to eternal life? Time shall reveal.`,

Goes back to sleep
Til next year
When it returns
And I fear
The rest will disappear`,
