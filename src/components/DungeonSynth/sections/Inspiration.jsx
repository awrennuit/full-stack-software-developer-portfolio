        atmosphere is vital to dungeon synth. songs that transport someone to a
        far away land. music that tells stories. while the overall composition
        is important, so is the overall aesthetic. the album art. the lore
        accompanying the album. maybe a short story or two. some physical
        releases even come with things like candles or incense to burn while
        listening.

        when i set out to make an album i make a loose idea of the story i want
        it to tell. the story that goes with the album usually isn't fully
        written until the music is done. i do, however, make an outline of the
        main story as well as some branching plot paths. the path to take with
        the narrative becomes clearer as the music gets further along.

      <p className="dungeon-synth__content-block">
        speaking of the music, i pick a set of maybe 4-8 instruments/synth
        patches to prevent decision paralysis. setting limitations on music may
        seem counterintuitive, but it can also help spark creativity. too many
        choices lends itself to indecision and abandoned projects. the timbre
        (or sound, like how a violin sounds different than a trumpet or a
        clarinet) of the instruments plays a major role, too. for instance,
        brass instruments can sound victorious or like a battle. whereas harp or
        piano can create a more delicate or introspective atmosphere. i make
        most of the sounds on my albums in Synth1, and try to create a couple
        new sounds for each album.
      </p>
      <p className="dungeon-synth__content-block">
        once the instruments are chosen, i start making some short musical
        ideas. nothing set in stone, and most of them end up getting deleted
        eventually. i make my entire album in one Reaper file, which helps me
        bounce around from song to song while i'm writing. i've found that
        trying to brute force my way through one song, then the next, the next,
        etc takes away from the joy and wonder of the creative process. if i'm
        not having fun in the creating, then it's not worth doing. if the music
        is feeling stale i usually take a break for a couple weeks. when i come
        back to it everything sounds fresh again.

        the most important thing to remember is that music is not a competition.
        everyone works at their own pace. we all have a different musical
        background with different things we like and dislike. what works for me
        might not work for you. and what works for you might not work for
        someone else. work at your own pace. don't compare yourself to others.
        and remember to have fun &lt;3
