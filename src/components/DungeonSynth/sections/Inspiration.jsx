        atmosphere is vital to dungeon synth. songs that transport someone to a
        far away land. music that tells stories. while the overall composition
        is important, so is the overall aesthetic. the album art. the lore
        accompanying the album. maybe a short story or two. some physical
        releases even come with things like candles or incense to burn while
        listening.

        when i set out to make an album i make a loose idea of the story i want
        it to tell. the story that goes with the album usually isn't fully
        written until the music is done. i do, however, make an outline of the
        main story as well as some branching plot paths. the path to take with
        the narrative becomes clearer as the music gets further along.

        the most important thing to remember is that music is not a competition.
        everyone works at their own pace. we all have a different musical
        background with different things we like and dislike. what works for me
        might not work for you. and what works for you might not work for
        someone else. work at your own pace. don't compare yourself to others.
        and remember to have fun &lt;3
