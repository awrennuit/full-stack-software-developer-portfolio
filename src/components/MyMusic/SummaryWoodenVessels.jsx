      <h3>Wooden Vessels</h3>

        Wooden Vessels is my youngest project. i took a few years off from music
        to learn a new trade and get settled in a new career. since i was at the
        computer a lot for work i decided to rebuild my music habit by figuring
        out how to make 'digital' music. previously almost all of the music i
        made was performed on live instruments, with drums being the exception.
        i purchased{' '}

        i knew that i wanted all of the Wooden Vessels songs to live within a
        fictional world of my creation. so i started building a tiny universe.
        it all started with the idea of a tavern situated between the forest and
        the main road. one side of the tavern has a field that's always a little
        dim and has a persistent misty fog over it. from there i made a basic
        map of the area, expanding it to have a few towns and some more
        landmarks. next i started naming everything and creating some basic
        cultural lore. this whole process is so much fun. i'm sorta making the
        lore as i go. each album has its own little story to go with it.

      <p className="u-music-container__content-block">
        the first album i full completed with Reaper is called 'The Bog'. as of
        November 2023 it hasn't been released yet, but it will be soon! it's a
        short introduction to the seasons of the land, called Dausedmera, and
        has a little lore drop about the significance of the bog. the first
        album i <em>released</em> was done for a quarterly(?){' '}

        after the randomly generated dungeon. since then i've been making more
        and more music. the backlog of albums yet to be released is growing. i
        discovered that i truly enjoy crafting fictional worlds and writing
        shorts stories about those places.
