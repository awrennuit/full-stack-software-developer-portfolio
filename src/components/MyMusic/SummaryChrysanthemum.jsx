        through a big post-rock phase. this led me to find some excellent
        ambient-ish artists like{' '}

        . i challenged myself to write a song in one day, and make it have
        either an ambient or post-rock vibe to it. it was a lot of fun, so i

        i started writing more and more ‘one sitting’ songs. many of the takes
        were improvised - i pressed record and played stuff. then i layered
        another track on top of that. and so on. eventually i got a looper and
        everything changed. suddenly i could play things <em>backward</em> on
        the fly. around this time i also got my hands on a delay pedal that
        simulated tape. i could play around with textures quite a bit now. the
        looper also allowed me to do live performances. it opened my whole world
        up. if you haven’t used a looper i highly recommend checking one out.
