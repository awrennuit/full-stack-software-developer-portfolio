          Growing up I was always coming up with new ideas and figuring out how
          to bring them to life. As I got older this manifested through visual
          arts and music. I performed with the school orchestra all through
          middle and high school, and have taught myself dozens of instruments
          since then.

          I also have an affinity for plants, which blossomed into a deep study
          of Western herbalism. Forming a bond with the plants that I use is
          very important to me, so I raise many of them from seed so I can study
          them and be present with them through their entire lifecycle from seed
          to sprout to bloom and back again to seed. Ask me about my homemade
          cough syrup sometime - it's delicious and nutritious!

          My passions for creating and understanding how things work on a
          fundamental level carry over into my software development. I have a
          profound appreciation for engaging, interactive, and accessible
          design. In addition, I love learning new technologies and working
          outside my comfort zone. I embrace feeling uncomfortable, because
          that's where the majority of growth takes place.
